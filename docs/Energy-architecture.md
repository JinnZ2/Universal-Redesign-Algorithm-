## üåæ 1. Biological Infrastructure

**Mycelial Cable Network:**  
Underground fiber and power co-deployed in mycelium-inspired patterns.  
- Routes self-optimize like root systems  
- Maintenance minimized via self-healing conduit enclosures  
- Adaptive conductivity depending on load  

**Thermal + Air Storage Roots:**  
- Underground chambers use air and mass for passive energy buffering  
- Gravity batteries support daily demand curves  
- Compressed air reserves offer emergency discharge

## üß† 2. Neural Control Layer

**Core Functions:**  
- Forecasting with LSTM/Transformer networks  
- Real-time rerouting based on edge node consensus  
- Anomaly detection via autoencoders  

**Learning + Evolution:**  
- Each node improves over time with reinforcement learning  
- Grid adapts to user behavior and environmental flux  
- Simulation environments run on parallel clusters (digital twins)

## ‚òÄÔ∏è 3. Generation + Capture

**Surface & Sky:**  
- Solar skin + helical wind turbines  
- Atmospheric water + electrostatic harvesting  
- Lightning divergence and ground induction coils  

**Subsurface:**  
- Geothermal heat exchange  
- Ferrofluid inductive tunnels  
- AI-regulated microbial biofuel reactions
