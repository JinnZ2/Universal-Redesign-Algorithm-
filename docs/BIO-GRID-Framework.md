## ðŸ“š Included Modules

- [Architecture Overview](./Architecture-overview.md)
- [Energy Architecture](./Energy-architecture.md)
- [Biological Principles](./biological-principles.md)
- [Use Cases](./use-cases.md)

## ðŸ”§ Use This For:

- System redesign proposals
- Resilient infrastructure planning
- Biomimetic energy systems
- Anything with a pulse, flow, or failure rate

## ðŸ§ª Scientifically Rooted In:

- Golden Ratio Optimization
- Fractal System Scaling
- Swarm Intelligence Algorithms
- Ecological Metabolism Theory

## ðŸš€ Next Moves:

1. Test this against a real system.
2. Pilot one vertical (e.g., microgrid or agri-logistics).
3. Capture metrics.
4. Share results back into the open framework.
